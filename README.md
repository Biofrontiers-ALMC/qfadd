# Modeling protein accumulation at DNA damage sites

This project contains code for analyzing and measuring fluorescence intensity at DNA damage sites, as well as the free difffusion simulation.

This work is currently under review at Nature Methods: "Q-FADD: A mechanistic approach for modeling the accumulation of proteins at sites of DNA damage by free diffusion".

## Image Analysis code

To run the image analysis code, navigate to the directory "image_analysis" and save the DNARepairAnalyzer.m file to your local drive. 

The code contains a class file for a MATLAB object.

## Simulation

The simulation code is written in Mathematica. The notebook file can be found in the directory "simulation".
